      "The main cast of these stories practice and perform live while using their body movements and/or voice as a form of artistic expression. Performing Arts are meant to capture attention with artistic beauty and deliver an unspoken message which evokes emotion in the audience. Often, characters will discuss the meanings behind classical sequences by renowned creators, or will strive to create their own.\n\nPrimary examples of Performing Arts are dance, theater, and opera, but the theme also includes other forms of artistic expression such as choreographed circus sequences, folk music, or rakugo. Popular contemporary music (e.g. idols, rock bands) is not included in Performing Arts.",

      "Romantic Subtext is a narrative which can at first appear to be Romance. These plots feature one or more main couples which seem to have romantic interest in each other, and whose relationship(s) will be central to the main story. However, while the story will set the couple up for heartwarming or embarrassing moments, these encounters will not lead to any significant romantic development, and the characters will not strive to deepen the relationship beyond a certain boundary.\n\nSome early indicators of Romantic Subtext include a missing emotional throughline (lack of personal reflection which allows the characters to understand their feelings and share these with the audience) and a lack of any conflict which will deepen or drive the relationship apart. Almost always, Romantic Subtext is a theme under the Comedy genre and these stories have plots designed to uplift the audience with positive emotion or amusement.\n\nNot to be confused with Romantic Sideplot, where a Romance narrative is side story to another main genre plot (e.g. Action or Adventure). Romance and Romantic Subtext are mutually exclusive by definition. Harem and Reverse Harem may fall into a similar pattern of absent romantic development, but will not be double-tagged.",

      "Show business, or Showbiz for short, describes the industry which produces popular entertainment media such as television shows, movies, radio programs, magazines, and mainstream contemporary music. One or main characters in Showbiz themed stories work in the entertainment industry, either as a performer (e.g. actress, model) or in business development (e.g. manager, producer). Their occupation should also be central to the main story's plotline. For example, simply dating a famous band member but never seeing that character perform or struggle with their profession is not Showbiz.\n\nIdols-themed stories are a subcategory of Showbiz, so they are not double-tagged with Idols (female) or Idols (male). Stories featuring a main cast of both female and male idols equally is rare, so those will be have the Showbiz theme.",
